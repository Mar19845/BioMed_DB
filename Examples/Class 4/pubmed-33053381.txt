AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by 
      coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome, a 
      characteristic hyperinflammatory response, vascular damage, microangiopathy, 
      angiogenesis and widespread thrombosis. Four stages of COVID-19 have been 
      identified: the first stage is characterised by upper respiratory tract 
      infection; the second by the onset of dyspnoea and pneumonia; the third by a 
      worsening clinical scenario dominated by a cytokine storm and the consequent 
      hyperinflammatory state; and the fourth by death or recovery. Currently, no 
      treatment can act specifically against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the 
      pathological features and different clinical phases of COVID-19, particularly in 
      patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, the classes of drugs used are 
      antiviral agents, inflammation inhibitors/antirheumatic drugs, low molecular 
      weight heparins, plasma, and hyperimmune immunoglobulins. During this emergency 
      period of the COVID-19 outbreak, clinical researchers are using and testing a 
      variety of possible treatments. Based on these premises, this review aims to 
      discuss the most updated pharmacological treatments to effectively act against 
      the SARS-CoV-2 infection and support researchers and clinicians in relation to 
      any current and future developments in curing COVID-19 patients.
